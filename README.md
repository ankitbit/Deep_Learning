# Deep_Learning
This repository contains training content on Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence

* In order to begin with [lectures on Deep Learning](https://upc-mai-dl.github.io/), I advise to have a strong background in Python programming language. Further, we can 

[Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence](http://dlai.deeplearning.barcelona/): The course is being run by FIB. 

* [First Contact with Tensorflow](http://jorditorres.org/research-teaching/tensorflow/first-contact-with-tensorflow-book/first-contact-with-tensorflow/): This is a fantastic textbook written by the course author himself and it begins from the very scratch assuming a zero knowledge on tensorflow as pre-requisite.
